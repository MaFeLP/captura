# Installation on Linux based systems
{: .note }
In the future, there will also be a flatpak build available!

## Installing from the tarball
Download the latest tarball [`captura.tar.xz`](https://github.com/MaFeLP/captura/releases/download/latest/captura.tar.xz) and
extract it into a separate directory. You can then double-click the `captura` executable in that folder or execute that
file from your shell.
