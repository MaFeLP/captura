# Installing on macOS
Download the latest [`captura.dmg`](https://github.com/MaFeLP/captura/releases/download/latest/captura.dmg)
from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MaFeLP/captura/releases/download/latest/). Then try to open this
downloaded file. You will be prompted with an error message:

![]({% link user/install/macos_not_verified.png %})

Click on `Done` and open your System Settings. There navigate to `Privacy and Security`, scroll all the way down and click
on `Open Anyway` for the program `captura`:

![]({% link user/install/macos_settings.png %})

Now allow the next dialog and enter your password or use Touch ID to continue.

Afterwards, open the `captura.dmg` file you just downloaded again.

You can now drag and drop the Application Bundle into your Applications folder:

![]({% link user/install/macos_copy.png %})

You can now try to open captura using launchpad or spotlight, but you will be greeted with the same error message from before.
Repeat the steps in the settings to allow the execution of the program.
